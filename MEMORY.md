# Project Memory

Persistent lessons for this Codex workflow project.

## Workflow

[LEARN:workflow] Specs before implementation reduce rework on ambiguous tasks.

[LEARN:workflow] Keep AGENTS.md short; push detail into codex/workflows and codex/skills.

[LEARN:workflow] Always log verification commands and outcomes in session logs.

## Research Practice

[LEARN:replication] Replicate baseline published targets before any extension.

[LEARN:literature] Maintain an explicit evidence matrix to prevent hand-wavy synthesis.

[LEARN:slides] Seminar slides still require full audit rigor (flow, notation, citations, visual checks).

## Repository Hygiene

[LEARN:structure] Research-first directory design improves focus: manuscript + research + presentations + assets.

[LEARN:quality] Quality gates are only useful when paired with actual execution/verification.
