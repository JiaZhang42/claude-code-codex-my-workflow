# Manuscript Workspace

This directory is the primary home for research-paper writing in this project.

## Structure

- `main/`: Main manuscript source files (`.qmd`, `.tex`, bibliography pointers, and section files)
- `appendix/`: Appendix content and supplemental derivations
- `output/`: Rendered artifacts (PDF/HTML/DOCX) when you choose to track them

## Conventions

- Keep empirical code in `scripts/` and exploratory work in `explorations/`.
- Keep shared figures in `Figures/`.
- Keep plans/specs/logs in `quality_reports/`.
- Keep seminar slide decks in `Slides/` and `Quarto/`, derived from research outputs when possible.

## Quality Standard

The same quality and verification standards apply here as elsewhere in the repository:

- plan-first for non-trivial tasks
- verification before completion
- quality gates (80/90/95)
- explicit session logging and requirement specs when scope is ambiguous
