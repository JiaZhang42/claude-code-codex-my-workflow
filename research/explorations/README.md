# Explorations

Low-commitment sandbox for uncertain or early-stage experiments.

## Use this when

- the question is still fuzzy
- you are testing alternative mechanisms quickly
- you expect failed branches and discarded outputs

## Structure per exploration

- `README.md`: goal, current status, next test
- `scripts/`: prototype code
- `output/`: intermediate artifacts

## Promotion rule

When a direction becomes coherent and defensible, graduate it to `research/ideas/idea_<topic>/`.

## Archiving

Move abandoned or completed exploratory projects to `research/explorations/ARCHIVE/` with a short rationale.
