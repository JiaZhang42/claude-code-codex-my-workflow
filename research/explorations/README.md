# Research Explorations

Sandbox for early-stage experiments.

## Lifecycle

1. Start in `research/explorations/<project>/`
2. Decide to either:
   - promote into `research/ideas/`, `research/literature/`, or `research/replications/`
   - archive under `research/explorations/ARCHIVE/`

## Minimum structure

- `README.md` (goal, current status, decisions)
- `scripts/` (prototype code)
- `output/` (intermediate results)
