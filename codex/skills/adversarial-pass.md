# Skill: Adversarial Pass

Use a critic/fixer/reviewer loop for high-stakes outputs.

## Loop

1. Critic pass: list hard failures and weaknesses.
2. Fix pass: apply prioritized fixes (critical -> major -> minor).
3. Verification pass: confirm fixes solved root issues.
4. Repeat up to 3 rounds.

## Use cases

- seminar decks before presentation
- manuscript drafts before external circulation
- replication reports before sign-off

## Output

Save round summaries in `quality_reports/` with explicit unresolved items.
