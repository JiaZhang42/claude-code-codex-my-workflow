# Skill: Idea Sprint

Convert a rough topic into a ranked set of testable research directions.

## Output requirements

- problem statement and stakes
- 3-5 research questions
- hypothesis + identification sketch for each
- feasibility and contribution ranking
- recommended lead direction with immediate next actions

## Save to

- `research/ideas/idea_<topic>/README.md`
- `quality_reports/research_ideation_<topic>.md`

## Review standard

Reject ideas that lack both a plausible identification path and a feasible data path.
