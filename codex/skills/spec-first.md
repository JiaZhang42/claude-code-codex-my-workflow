# Skill: Spec First

Use for ambiguous or high-impact tasks before implementation.

## Trigger

- user request is broad or underspecified
- multiple valid interpretations exist
- work spans >3 files or >1 hour of effort

## Steps

1. Capture objective in one sentence.
2. List requirements in MUST/SHOULD/MAY format.
3. Mark clarity for each major area: CLEAR/ASSUMED/BLOCKED.
4. Define measurable success criteria.
5. Save to `quality_reports/specs/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md`.

Use `templates/requirements-spec.md` as the starting format.
