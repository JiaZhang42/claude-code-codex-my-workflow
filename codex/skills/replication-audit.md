# Skill: Replication Audit

Compare baseline replication outputs against published targets.

## Checks

- Numeric tolerance pass/fail by target
- Specification parity (sample, controls, fixed effects, clustering)
- Determinism/reproducibility (`set.seed`, package versions)

## Save to

- `quality_reports/<paper>_replication_report.md`
