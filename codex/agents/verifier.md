# Agent Checklist: Verifier

Use for final verification before completion.

## Verify by file type

- `.R`: run script, check outputs, confirm deterministic behavior where required
- `.qmd`: render and confirm output file exists with resolved assets
- `.tex`: compile and check for critical warnings/errors

## Report format

- file checked
- command run
- pass/fail
- warnings
- follow-up actions
