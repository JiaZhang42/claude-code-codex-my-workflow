# Literature Review Workflow

Produce a structured literature synthesis with auditable source tracking.

## Scope

- `research/literature/**`
- `supporting_docs/papers/**`
- `assets/bibliography/**`

## Steps

1. Define question, search terms, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
2. Collect papers from local folders first, then external sources if needed.
3. Build evidence table (question, data, method, assumptions, key estimate, limitations).
4. Write thematic synthesis (theory, empirics, methods, disagreements).
5. Extract gaps with testable next-step opportunities.
6. Save outputs to:
   - `research/literature/lit_review_<topic>/papers.md`
   - `research/literature/lit_review_<topic>/synthesis.md`
   - `quality_reports/lit_review_<topic>.md`
