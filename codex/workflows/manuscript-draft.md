# Manuscript Draft Workflow

Convert analysis outputs into a circulation-ready manuscript draft.

## Inputs

- validated empirical results
- literature synthesis
- contribution statement

## Steps

1. Draft structure in `manuscript/main/`:
   - question and contribution
   - design and assumptions
   - results and interpretation
   - limitations
2. Align claims with actual evidence and tables.
3. Run manuscript review (`codex/skills/manuscript-review.md`).
4. Run citation audit (`codex/agents/citation-auditor.md`).
5. Resolve major concerns and finalize draft.

## Deliverables

- manuscript draft in `manuscript/main/`
- review report in `quality_reports/paper_review_<draft>.md`

## Exit criteria

- no unresolved major methodological or citation issues
- draft ready for advisor/coauthor review
