# Seminar Slides Workflow

Generate seminar slides from research outputs with full audit rigor.

## Scope

- `presentations/beamer/**`
- `presentations/quarto/**`
- `assets/figures/**`
- `manuscript/**`

## Steps

1. Draft slide narrative from manuscript contribution and evidence.
2. Ensure notation/citation consistency with manuscript.
3. Run full slide audits:
   - proofreading
   - visual layout checks
   - pedagogy/flow checks
   - Beamer/Quarto parity checks when both formats exist
4. Compile/render and verify assets are resolved.
5. Score and block if quality score < 80.

## Non-negotiable

Seminar scope does not reduce quality standards.
